summary of problems still to be addressed:

proptest gets two additional test failures when updated for the
new rand, I have opened a bug report about this upstream.

We need to figure out what to do about rust-petgraph, I tried to port it to the
new version of rust-quickcheck but failed, i'm leaning towards simply removing
the quickcheck feature from petgraph.

newsboat is maintained outside the rust team, coordination with it's maintainer
or a NMU will be needed.

Reverse dependencies of rust-rand*

elan:
   builds after some patching of dependencies, no tests run.
newsboat:
   builds after patching of dependencies, tests appear to be run as part of
   build, not rust team, bug filed at
   https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1004259
rust-extprim
   just a dependency bump needed for rand, I also fixed some other issues with
   the testsuite.
rust-hyperfine:
   not in testing, not investigated yet.
rust-im-rc
   rand dependency was dealt with with a simple patch, but it
   took a bit of effort to get the testsuite to work.
rust-nitrokey
   not investigated yet
rust-num-bigint
   not investigated yet
rust-num-complex
   not investigated yet
rust-parking-lot-core-0.4
   not investigated yet
rust-pbkdf2
   not investigated yet
rust-phf-generator
   not investigated yet
rust-pleaser
   not investigated yet
rust-proptest:
   patch applied from upstream, but introduces 4 new test failures, i've
   uploaded it to experimental with the tests in question disabled but I don't
   want to upload to unstable until I have upstream's
   opinion on the matter
rust-petgraph:
   Failed to port to new quickcheck, will probablly drop feature. Also seems to
   have issues running tests with no-default-features which will need to be
   looked at.
rust-quickcheck 
   updating to 1.0 (which has switched tor rand 0.8 upstream seems the most
   sensible course of action, though it has it's own reverse-dependencies to
   deal with.
rust-statistical
   not in testing not investigated yet
rust-rspotify
   not in testing and broken in unstable
rust-tempfile:
   tests passed after updating to 3.2.0 (3.3.0 has dependencies which can't be 
   satisfied without adding new packages)
rust-time
   not investigated yet
rust-trust-dns-proto
   not investigated yet
rust-uuid
   not investigated yet


Packages depending on rust-quickcheck

rust-diesel

rust-im-rc:
  patched for quickcheck at the same time as rand
rust-num-bigint:
  not in testing not investigated yet.
rust-petgraph:
  Failed to port to new quickcheck, will probablly drop feature.
