vhost-device-vsock is a vhost-user device implementation that emulates a virtio-
vsock device, allowing guest applications to use AF_VSOCK sockets to communicate
with host services or daemons. It enables bidirectional communication between
applications running inside a virtual machine (guest) and applications running
on the host or other VMs.
