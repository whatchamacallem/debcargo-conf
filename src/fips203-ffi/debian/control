Description: Library for FIPS 203 (ML-KEM)
 This package contains a dynamic library (shared object) implementing
 the Module-Lattice-Based Key-Encapsulation Mechanism, also known as
 ML-KEM or FIPS 203.
 .
 It is written in pure Rust with minimal and mainstream dependencies,
 and without any unsafe code. All three security parameter sets are
 fully supported and tested. The implementation operates in
 constant-time (outside of rho, which is part of the encapsulation key
 sent across the trust boundary in the clear), and focuses on
 correctness, simplicity, security, and a stable API.
 .
 See <https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.203.pdf>
 for a full description of the target functionality.
