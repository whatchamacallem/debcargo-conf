Comment:
 The Copyright file claims copyright Mozilla Foundation.
 Henri Sivonen <hsivonen@hsivonen.fi> is listed as author and works for mozilla.

 The git history for this project only goes back to 2022, but the readme says
 that parts of the code were copied from encoding-rs, another project carrying
 Mozilla Foundation copyright which goes back to 2016

 According to the Copyright file, he implementation for Utf8CharIndices was
 adapted from the CharIndices implementation of the Rust standard library at
 revision ab32548539ec38a939c1b58599249f3b54130026 (in 2022)
 (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/ab32548539ec38a939c1b58599249f3b54130026/library/core/src/str/iter.rs).

 CharOffsetIterator (later reanamed CharOffsets and finally  CharIndicies) was
 added to the rust standard libary in 2013
 ( https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/e33fca9ffefffc982bbde860251f11b191457412 )
