rust-clap-builder (4.4.4-1) UNRELEASED-FIXME-AUTOGENERATED-DEBCARGO; urgency=medium

  * Team upload.
  * Package clap_builder 4.4.4 from crates.io using debcargo 2.6.0
  * Remove dev-dependencies on color-print.patch and trycmd.patch, they are
    not in Debian and do not seem to be needed by the tests that are included
    in the crates.io release.
  * Relax dependency on terminal_size.
  * Establish baseline for tests.
