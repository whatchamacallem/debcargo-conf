Hurl is a command line tool that runs HTTP requests defined in a simple plain
text format. It can chain request, capture values and evaluate queries on
headers and body response. Hurl is very versatile: it can be used for both
fetching data and testing HTTP sessions. Hurl makes it easy to work with HTML
content, REST / SOAP / GraphQL APIs, or any other XML / JSON based APIs.
