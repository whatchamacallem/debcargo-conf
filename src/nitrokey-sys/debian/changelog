rust-nitrokey-sys (3.4.1-2) UNRELEASED-FIXME-AUTOGENERATED-DEBCARGO; urgency=medium

  [ Robin Krahl ]
  * Package nitrokey-sys 3.4.1 from crates.io using debcargo 2.2.9
  * Don't link against libhidapi-libusb since we don't directly use its symbols
    (and libnitrokey already links against it, as it should).
