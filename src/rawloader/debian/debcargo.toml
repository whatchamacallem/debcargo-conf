description = """
This is a rust library to extract the raw data and some metadata from digital camera images. Given an image in a supported format and camera you will be able to get everything needed to process the image:

  - Identification of the camera that produced the image (both the EXIF name and a cleaned up name)
  - The raw pixels themselves, exactly as encoded by the camera
  - The number of pixels to crop on the top, right, bottom, left of the image to only use the actual image area
  - The black and white points of each of the color channels
  - The multipliers to apply to the color channels for the white balance
  - A conversion matrix between the camera color space and XYZ
  - The description of the bayer pattern itself so you'll know which pixels are which color
