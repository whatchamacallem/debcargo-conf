description = '''
cntr mounts the file system from one container or the host into the target
container, by creating a nested container with the help of a FUSE filesystem.
This allows to ship minimal runtime image in production and limit the surface
for exploits.
.
Natively supported: docker, podman, LXC, LXD, rkt, systemd-nspawn, containerd;
For other container engines, cntr also takes PIDs.
