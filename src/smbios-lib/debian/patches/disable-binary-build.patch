Description: disable building and running the bundled binary
 The upstream crate provides both a library (smbioslib) and a binary
 tool (smbiosdump). The binary requires root privileges at build/test
 time, which is unsuitable for the Debian build environment. Since the
 Debian package only ships the library, the bin section and the
 sudo-based runner configuration are commented out
