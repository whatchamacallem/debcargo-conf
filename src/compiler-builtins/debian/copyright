Comment:
 This project is a Rust translation of the older C "compiler-rt" project from
 the LLVM project.
 .
 README.md mentions references to the "University of Illinois "BSD-Like"
 license" which is an older name for the NCSA license, which is the old license
 of compiler-rt. This information is obsolete - no part of compiler-rt exists
 today in this crate, and so the older copyright holders and license do not
 actually apply to the current version of the code.
 .
 See discussion:
 https://github.com/rust-lang/compiler-builtins/issues/307
 .
 In summary, MIT or Apache-2.0 is therefore the correct license for this crate,
 minus the libm embedded crate described separately below.

Comment:
 This project is a Rust translation of the older C "libm" project from MUSL
 and FreeBSD, which itself is derived from older FOSS code copyrighted by Sun.
 .
 Some file headers make reference to other copyright holders but they are in
 fact copyright holders for the original C files from which this project is
 derived (LLVM and libm), none of which remain in this source code. So those
 original copyright holders do not hold copyright on this derivative.
 .
 One exception to this is that some comments were copied verbatim into the Rust
 code. Hence, the older copyright applies to those comments. "MIT or
 Apache-2.0" applies to all the Rust code excluding these comments.
 .

 GCC RUNTIME LIBRARY EXCEPTION
 Version 3.1, 31 March 2009
 .
 Copyright © 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
 .
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
 document, but changing it is not allowed.
 .
 This GCC Runtime Library Exception ("Exception") is an additional permission
 under section 7 of the GNU General Public License, version 3 ("GPLv3"). It
 applies to a given file (the "Runtime Library") that bears a notice placed by
 the copyright holder of the file stating that the file is governed by GPLv3
 along with this Exception.
 .
 When you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of certain GCC
 header files and runtime libraries with the compiled program. The purpose of
 this Exception is to allow compilation of non-GPL (including proprietary)
 programs to use, in this way, the header files and runtime libraries covered
 by this Exception.
 .
 0. Definitions.
 .
 A file is an "Independent Module" if it either requires the Runtime Library
 for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an interface
 provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based on the Runtime
 Library.
 .
 "GCC" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without
 modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of the GNU
 General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any subsequent versions
 published by the FSF.
 .
 "GPL-compatible Software" is software whose conditions of propagation,
 modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with the
 license of GCC.
 .
 "Target Code" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual target
 processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for input to an
 assembler, loader, linker and/or execution phase. Notwithstanding that, Target
 Code does not include data in any format that is used as a compiler
 intermediate representation, or used for producing a compiler intermediate
 representation.
 .
 The "Compilation Process" transforms code entirely represented in
 non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in Java
 Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example, use of source
 code generators and preprocessors need not be considered part of the
 Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be understood as
 starting with the output of the generators or preprocessors.
 .
 A Compilation Process is "Eligible" if it is done using GCC, alone or with
 other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any work based
 on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to optimize any GCC
 intermediate representations would not qualify as an Eligible Compilation
 Process.
 .
 1. Grant of Additional Permission.
 You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by combining the
 Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such propagation would
 otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that all Target Code was
 generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You may then convey such a
 combination under terms of your choice, consistent with the licensing of the
 Independent Modules.
 .
 2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.
 The availability of this Exception does not imply any general presumption that
 third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft requirements of the license
 of GCC.
