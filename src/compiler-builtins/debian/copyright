Comment:
 This project is a Rust translation of the older C "compiler-rt" project from
 the LLVM project.
 .
 README.md mentions references to the "University of Illinois "BSD-Like"
 license" which is an older name for the NCSA license, which is the old license
 of compiler-rt. This information is obsolete - no part of compiler-rt exists
 today in this crate, and so the older copyright holders and license do not
 actually apply to the current version of the code.
 .
 See discussion:
 https://github.com/rust-lang/compiler-builtins/issues/307
 .
 In summary, MIT or Apache-2.0 is therefore the correct license for this crate,
 minus the libm embedded crate described separately below.

Comment:
 This project is a Rust translation of the older C "libm" project from MUSL
 and FreeBSD, which itself is derived from older FOSS code copyrighted by Sun.
 .
 Some file headers make reference to other copyright holders but they are in
 fact copyright holders for the original C files from which this project is
 derived (LLVM and libm), none of which remain in this source code. So those
 original copyright holders do not hold copyright on this derivative.
 .
 One exception to this is that some comments were copied verbatim into the Rust
 code. Hence, the older copyright applies to those comments. "MIT or
 Apache-2.0" applies to all the Rust code excluding these comments.
 .
