# data/testdata/* is not used because we don't set RAWLER_RAWDB. And we don't
# set it because we don't have the rawdb. This permits to avoid checking
# copyright content of ~3600 files. I already checked files in
# data/testdata/[A-L]* and no additional entry was required for them here.
# If the folder is required in future, one would have to check
# data/testdata/[M-Z]*
