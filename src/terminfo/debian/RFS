tests disabled because they fail inside sbuild.
The problem is that some tests try to get terminal
colors for the test, and it fails because
of the build environment inside sbuild.
I did compile the crate pointing cargo to local registry
with only debian packaged deps, and tests do pass when run
in a regular terminal.
