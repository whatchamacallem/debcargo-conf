rust-tracing-subscriber (0.3.16-1) UNRELEASED-FIXME-AUTOGENERATED-DEBCARGO; urgency=medium

  * Team upload.
  * Package tracing-subscriber 0.3.16 from crates.io using debcargo 2.6.0 (Closes: #1022238)
  * Revert upstream switch from ansi_term to nu-ansi-term since nu-ansi-term is
    not in Debian.
  * Diable tests which depend on tracing-mock which is not in Debian or even on
    crates.io so the rest of the tests can run.
  * Change expected paths in some tests to match the results we get (presumablly
    the paths have changed because we are not testing as part of a larger
    workspace).
  * Mark tests and benches with feature requirements.
