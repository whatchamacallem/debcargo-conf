description = """Silver-Platter makes it possible to contribute automatable changes to source
code in a version control system.
.
It automatically creates a local checkout of a remote repository,
make user-specified changes, publish those changes on the remote hosting
site and then creates pull request.
.
In addition to that, it can also perform basic maintenance on branches
that have been proposed for merging - such as restarting them if they
have conflicts due to upstream changes.
