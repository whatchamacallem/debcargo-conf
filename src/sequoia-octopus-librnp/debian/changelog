rust-sequoia-octopus-librnp (1.4.1-1) UNRELEASED-FIXME-AUTOGENERATED-DEBCARGO; urgency=medium

  * Package sequoia-octopus-librnp 1.4.1 from crates.io using debcargo 2.5.0
  * Because this is a cdylib crate, and debcargo and dh-cargo don't know
    how to handle that yet (see #1017681 and #1017682), we diverge pretty
    widely from rust-team common practice.
  * Closes: #1005740
