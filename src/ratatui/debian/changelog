rust-ratatui (0.23.0-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  * Team upload.
  * Package ratatui 0.23.0 from crates.io using debcargo 2.6.0
  * Update relax-dep-versions.patch for new upstream and current situation
    in Debian.
  * Drop support-older-termion-versions.patch, no longer needed.
  * Move removal of cargo-husky earlier in the quilt series, because it causes
    problems testing.
  * Add upstream patch to make demo build with termion 1.
  * Reinstate feature comments that are stripped out by the "cargo publish"
    process as docuement_features needs them.
  * Remove reference to benches that are not included in the crates.io
    release.
  * Remove dev-dependency on fakeit, it's not in Debian and doesn't seem
    to be needed.
