rust-wayland-client (0.29.4-2) UNRELEASED-FIXME-AUTOGENERATED-DEBCARGO; urgency=medium

  * Team upload.
  * Package wayland-client 0.29.4 from crates.io using debcargo 2.5.0
  * Be less restrictive about versions of the nix crate, this has the potential
    for future breakage but overall is likely to be less work than continuously
    bumping the dependencies.
