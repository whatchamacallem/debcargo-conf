Comment: Unicode copyright attribution is unncessary
 The copyright attribution to unicode mentioned in README.md is not valid in
 debian as the mentioned unicode data (files) are not included in the source.
 Instead the unicode-data package is used to get the relevant files, d/rules
 contains the instructions for symliking them during build time. Pregenerated
 files are all excluded from the source and regenerated at build time.
