    to be included in the crates.io release.
  * Remove dependency of "deprecated" feature on "clap_derive/deprecated", this
    avoids the generation of an additional binary package, and the "deprecated"
    feature is only used to enable additional deprecation warnings so it's not
    super-important.
  * Make once-cell dependency non optional to avoid generating an aditional
    binary package.
  * Prevent generatoin of "clap" binary package that appeared with the update to
    the new upstream version. The only binary that ends up in it appears to be
    a trivial test program.
