rust-tree-sitter-cli (0.20.6-1) UNRELEASED-FIXME-AUTOGENERATED-DEBCARGO; urgency=medium

  * Package tree-sitter-cli 0.20.6 from crates.io using debcargo 2.5.0
  * New patches
    + relax-deps: Allow use of pretty-assertions 1
    + skip-tests-using-fixtures: Add "#[ignore]" attribute to tests which
      rely on unpackaged fixtures
    + writable-scratch-dir: Use CARGO_TARGET_DIR or CARGO_TARGET_TMPDIR as the
      SCRATCH_DIR for tests, so autopkgtests have a writable directory to use
  * Disable benchmarks since they rely on unpackaged fixtures
