  * Team upload.
  * Package miniz_oxide 0.4.4 from crates.io using debcargo 2.4.4
  * Revert upstream switch from adler32 to adler crate as we do not currently
    have the adler crate in Debian.
  * Remove features that are only relavent when using the crate to build
    the standard library and which depend on rustc-std-workspace-alloc which
    is not in debian.
  * Remove "compiler-builtins" feature, it fails to build and the ftpmasters
    are rejecting new rust feature packages.
