coreutils is packaged in an unusual way. Many packages are published on
crates.io. As we don't want to package them separately, we have to do
some voodoo magic.

cp Cargo.toml build/coreutils/
cp -R coreutils.upstream/src/* build/coreutils/src/
sudo dpkg -i librust-rust-ini-dev_0.16.0-1_amd64.deb  librust-unicase-dev_2.6.0-1_amd64.deb librust-ordered-multimap-dev_0.3.1-1_amd64.deb librust-hashbrown-dev_0.9.1-1_amd64.deb librust-rustc-std-workspace-alloc-dev_1.0.0-1_amd64.deb
