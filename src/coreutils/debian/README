coreutils is packaged in an unusual way. Many packages are published on
crates.io. As we don't want to package them separately, we have to do
some voodoo magic.

cd <source>
cp -R $TARGET/src/coreutils/debian $TARGET/build/coreutils/
cp Cargo.toml $TARGET/build/coreutils/
cp -R src/* $TARGET/build/coreutils/src/
cd $TARGET/build
tar zcvf rust-coreutils_0.0.2.orig.tar.gz coreutils/
rm -rf coreutils.orig
sudo dpkg -i librust-rust-ini-dev_0.16.0-1_amd64.deb  librust-unicase-dev_2.6.0-1_amd64.deb librust-ordered-multimap-dev_0.3.1-1_amd64.deb librust-hashbrown-dev_0.9.1-1_amd64.deb librust-rustc-std-workspace-alloc-dev_1.0.0-1_amd64.deb


We are following the version of the GNU version as we have some packages
having an explicit minimal dep (ex: initramfs-tools-core, xinit, initscripts)
