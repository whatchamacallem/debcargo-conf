depends on:

- terminfo (new package)
- vte (needs version already in debcargo-conf repo(0.8.0) , but not yet in unstable(0.3.3). Patched out the unnecessary 'nightly' feature from repo version) to avoid creating a new feature package
  - vte-generate-state-changes (new package)
  - utf8parse (version bumped to 0.2.0)
