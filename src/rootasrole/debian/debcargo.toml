description = """Traditional Linux system administration relies on a single powerful user,
the superuser (root), who holds all system privileges. This model does not
adhere to the principle of least privilege, as any program executed with 
superuser rights gains far more privileges than necessary.
.
The RootAsRole project offers a role-based approach for managing Linux
capabilities. It includes the dosr (do switch role) tool, which allows users
to use another role with specific privileges and rights. It includes the 
chsr (change switch role) tool, which enables users to configure their
roles. This approach enables co-administration of a system by multiple users.
