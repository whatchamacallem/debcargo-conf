rust-tower-http (0.4.4-2) UNRELEASED-FIXME-AUTOGENERATED-DEBCARGO; urgency=medium

  * Team upload.
  * Package tower-http 0.4.4 from crates.io using debcargo 2.6.1
  * Stop patching mime dependency, it turns out the newer version is actually
    needed in some feature configurations. (Closes: #1063784)
  * Bump some deps to allow testing with -Z minimal-versions.
  * Deal with tests that require test data that is not included in the crates.io
    release. Some tests are modified to use different test data, others are
    disabled.
  * Fix test feature requirements.
