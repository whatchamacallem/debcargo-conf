sq is a command-line interface for OpenPGP, structured using
subcommands and implemented in Rust.

Subcommands include: help, decrypt, encrypt, sign, verify, armor,
dearmor, autocrypt, inspect, key, keyring, certify, packet.

It offers modern cryptographic algorithms by default, like Ed25519 and
Curve25519.

The tool offers both message handling (encryption, decryption,
signing, and verification), and key and certificate management (key
generation, certificate maintenance, and certification), and is
interoperable with other major OpenPGP implementations like GnuPG
(gpg).
