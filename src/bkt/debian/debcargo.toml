description = """
bkt (pronounced "bucket") is a subprocess caching utility written in Rust,
inspired by bash-cache. Wrapping expensive process invocations with bkt allows
callers to reuse recent invocations without complicating their application
logic. This can be useful in shell prompts, interactive applications such as
fzf, and long-running programs that poll other processes.
