description = """
3cpio is a tool to manage initramfs cpio files for the Linux kernel. The Linux
kernel's initramfs buffer format is based around the newc or crc cpio formats.
Multiple cpio archives can be concatenated and the last archive can be
compressed. Different compression algorithms can be used depending on what
support was compiled into the Linux kernel. 3cpio is tailored to initramfs
cpio files and will not gain support for other cpio formats.

3cpio supports creating, examining, listing, and extracting the content of
the initramfs cpio.
