rust-zvariant (2.0.0-3) UNRELEASED-FIXME-AUTOGENERATED-DEBCARGO; urgency=medium

  * Team upload.
  * Package zvariant 2.0.0 from crates.io using debcargo 2.5.0
  * Disable the arrayvec feature, my attempts to port it to the
    new version of arrayvec were a failure and nothing depends on
    it.
  * Set collapse_features in debcargo.toml (the features are already
    collapsed in the archive)
