procs lists processes and their stats, like ps but in a more
human-readable way.

It displays additional information like TCP/UDP ports being
listened on by the process, its read/write throughput and the
name of the Docker container in which it is running, if any.

It supports colorized output, automatic theme detection based
on terminal background, multi-column keyword search, paging,
watch mode and tree view. The output can be customized using
a configuration file.

Processes can be filtered by command, user or PID and the
filters can be combined using logical operators.
