Description: Debian doesn't ship or encourage bundled/vendored mechanisms

Furthermore, these additional variants create a huge Provides: line in
debian/control, which itself can cause problems for some tooling.

It would be preferable to declaratively omit these features, but until
https://bugs.debian.org/1014613 is closed in debcargo, we can just
patch them.

We also drop in_gecko, since this is not how libsqlite3-sys is built
on debian.
