this is only available with libstd >= 1.5.6, before that it was experimental..
but we don't have this information readily available here, since the bindings
are generated in zstd-sys, and the linkage happens via that crate as well..

since nothing is using the new interface yet, patch it out until libzstd 1.5.6
is in testing, then we can revert this workaround..
