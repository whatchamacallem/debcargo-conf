Description: Disable test on -f32::NAN
 which fails on riscv64. The exact cause still needs investigation.
 .
 Justification: Rust does not guarantee that NaN has a deterministic or
 portable bit pattern. The current CBOR specification (RFC 8949) doesn not
 mention -NaN, only suggesting NaN be encoded as 0xf97e00. Unless someone is
 encoding extra information in its payload, distinguishing "different" NaNs
 isn't terribly useful.
