As of 2025-04, the version of czkawka shipped in Debian is built without
support of JXL and AVIF formats.

These features are disabled by patches in the Debian source packages
rust-czkawka-core, rust-czkawka-cli & rust-czkawka-gui.

Rationale can be found in the headers of the patches in theses packages.
