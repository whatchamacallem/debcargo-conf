description = """
Czkawka (tch-kav-ka, hiccup) is a simple, fast and free app to remove
unnecessary files from your computer.

Features:
- Written in memory safe Rust
- Amazingly fast - due to using more or less advanced algorithms and
  multithreading
- Free, Open Source without ads
- Multiplatform - works on Linux, Windows and macOS
- Cache support - second and further scans should be a lot faster than
  the first one
- CLI frontend - for easy automation
- GUI frontend - uses modern GTK 3 and looks similar to FSlint
- Rich search option - allows setting absolute included and excluded
  directories, set of allowed file extensions or excluded items with
  the * wildcard

  - Duplicates - Finds duplicates basing on file name, size, hash,
    first 1 MB of hash
  - Empty Folders - Finds empty folders with the help of an advanced
    algorithm

    given location
  - Empty Files - Looks for empty files across the drive
