# Do not run tests.
#
# 1. This crate is literally translating conditional compilation macros to
# corresponding values. There's not much point in testing, other than mistyped
# values.
#
# 2. Its own test only covers x86_64-linux-gnu and some basic Windows, macOS
# conditions, not the architectures Debian supports, and the way it's built
# actively fails archs not supported.
#
# 3. The test described in 2 runs in a bizarre way. Read tests/binary.rs and
# you'll know what I mean.
