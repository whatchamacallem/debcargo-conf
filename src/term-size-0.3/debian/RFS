Notes:
- The term_size crate is no longer maintained, and its GitHub README encourages
people to use terminal_size instead. The current state is that it has these
versions: 0.3.2 released 2020-05-02, 1.0.0-beta.2 released 2020-05-03, and
1.0.0-beta1 released 2017-12-08. Updating it results in 1.0.0-beta1, which is
older than 0.3.2. Pinning it to 1.0.0-beta.2 results in a term-size-1 package.
I prefer maintaining an old yet stable version than introducing this
complication.
