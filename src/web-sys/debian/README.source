dak limits the length of the Provides field since it has caused
breakage in downstream distros when the field is too long.

web-sys provides an extremely large number of features so we are
unable to use our typical Provides for every feature and version.
Therefore, we only include Provides for features that are actually
used in Debian. If you add a Provides line, also add the corresponding
autopkgtest.
