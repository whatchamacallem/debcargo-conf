cbindgen can be used to generate C bindings for Rust code.
It is currently being developed to support creating bindings for
WebRender (by Mozilla for Firefox), but has been designed to support
any project.

 * Builds bindings for a crate, its mods, its dependent crates, and their mods
 * Only the necessary types for exposed functions are given bindings
 * Can specify annotations for controlling some aspects of binding
 * Support for generic structs and unions
 * Support for exporting constants and statics
 * Customizable formatting, can be used in C or C++ projects
 * Support for generating #ifdef's for #[cfg] attributes
 * Support for #[repr(sized)] tagged enum's
