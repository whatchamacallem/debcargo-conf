Description: Fix tests on ppc64
 The `resize_database` test assumes the system's page size is 4k.
 However, Debian ppc64el systems have a page size of 64k, breaking this
 assumption, leading to this test failing on this architecture. As
 there doesn't seem to be a (easy) way to make it more generic, let's
 just disable it for this architecture.
