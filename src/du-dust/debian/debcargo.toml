description = """
dust is meant to give you an instant overview of which directories are using
disk space without requiring sort or head.

It will list a slightly-less-than-the-terminal-height number of the biggest
subdirectories or files and will smartly recurse down the tree to find the
larger ones. There is no need for a '-d' flag or a '-h' flag. The largest
subdirectories will be colored. Optionally it can print its output in JSON
format.
