description = """
speakersafetyd is a userspace daemon that implements an analogue of the Texas
Instruments Smart Amp speaker protection model.
.
Apple Silicon Macs mostly use amp chip which provides sense lines for the
voltage and current across the voice coil of the connected speaker. These
codecs are designed to be used in embedded applications where device firmware
takes this information and uses it to protect the speaker from damage.
.
speakersafetyd is an implementation of a speaker protection model. It solves
the problem described above by allowing parties interested in compatible
devices to quickly and easily implement a speaker protection model for those
devices. Only Apple Silicon Macs under Linux are currently supported, however
the model applies to all loudspeakers. The daemon itself should be easy enough
to adapt for any device that provides V/ISENSE data in a manner similar to
TAS2764.
