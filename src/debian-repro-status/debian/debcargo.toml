Command-line tool for querying the reproducibility status of your installed
Debian packages using data from a rebuilderd instance such as
reproduce.debian.net.

Instead of putting blind trust into Debian build servers this would query
independent build servers (that you consider trustworthy) whether they came to
the same bit-for-bit identical .deb files when building from source.

Note this tool doesn't give you any security guarantees in itself, as the
packages have already been installed at this point. It gives you a good idea
whether a reproducible-only policy could be realistically enforced with your
specific selection of packages however (which would then give you security
advantages).

This code is heavily inspired and partially yoinked from arch-repro-status
authored by Orhun Parmaksız.
