description = """
Kanata is an advanced software keyboard remapper, allowing to
add alternate layers to non-programmable keyboards like
built-in laptop keyboards. It can be used as a QMK alternative for
hardware not supporting it.

Notable features include:

 * Human-readable configuration file.
 * Live reloading of the configuration for easy testing of your changes.
 * Multiple layers of key functionality
 * Advanced actions such as tap-hold, unicode output, dynamic and static
   macros
 * Vim-like leader sequences to execute other actions

Due to the very sensitive nature of this program, which effectively acts
as a keylogger to allow extra functionality, a great deal of care need
to be observed. While the packaging of this program aims at bringing
state-of-the-art security practises to its users, they should be aware
of the implications of installing and running such software.
