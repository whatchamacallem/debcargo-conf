rust-kanata (1.9.0-7) unstable; urgency=medium

  * The previous versions of the kanata package installed the required udev
    rule in /etc/udev/rules.d/. However this directory is reserved for
    user-installed rules, and installing files here creates a lintian warning.
  * This new version installs the udev rules file in /usr/lib/udev/rules.d/.
  * You want to delete the previous file matching
    /etc/udev/rules.d/*kanata*.rules to avoid rules duplication.
