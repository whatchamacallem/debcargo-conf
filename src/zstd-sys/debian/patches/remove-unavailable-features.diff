Description: Remove unavailable features
 As we use Debian packaged libzstd not the bundled, some features are
 not (can not be) enabled at build time and unavailable, or made no-op:
 - debug, fat-lto, no_asm, thin, thin-lto: only useful with bundled zstd
 - zstdmt: deprecated, upstream hidden by default
 - legacy: Debian package has it on
 - pkg-config: always used
 - std: no-op with use-std-c-ffi.patch
