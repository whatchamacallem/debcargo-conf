bat is a drop-in cat(1) replacement featuring:

 * syntax highlighting for a large number of languages;
 * git integration;
 * automatic paging;
 * a user-friendly command-line interface.

In this package the executable and its manpage have been renamed from ‘bat’ to
‘batcat’ because of a file name clash with another Debian package.
