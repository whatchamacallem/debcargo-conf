Skip test_arch_m68k_detail and test_arch_tms320c64x_detail on big endian
systems.

 * Failures reported upstream test_arch_tms320c64x_detail
 * Not a regression compared to the situation in testing at the time of
   writing the patch.
 * Failures were causing problems for testing migration of libc crate
   due to the fact that the tests were skipped in plain testing tests
   but run for unstable -> testing migration tests.
