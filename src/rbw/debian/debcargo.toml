description = """
rbw is a command line client for Bitwarden that runs a background
agent to keep keys in memory. This avoids the stateless behavior of
the official client and removes the need to manually pass temporary
keys. The agent works similarly to ssh-agent or gpg-agent, making
command line access to Bitwarden simpler and more convenient.
