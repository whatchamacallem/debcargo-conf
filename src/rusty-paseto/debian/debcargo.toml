# v3 depends on p384 and v4 depends on ed25519-dalek, which seem to both have
# an error type ultimately imported from signature. They are then derived into
# this crate's error type using thiserror, which prohibits two variants being
# #[from] the same source error type.
#
# See https://github.com/rrrodzilla/rusty_paseto/issues/36, though the author
# asked why one would enable v3 and v4 at the same time, more or less implying
# that one should not, without expressing intent to fix or wontfix.
