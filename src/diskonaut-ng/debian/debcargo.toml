Given a path on your system, diskonaut scans it and indexes its metadata
to memory so you can explore its contents.

Once completed, you can navigate through subfolders, getting a visual
treemap representation of what's taking up your disk space. You can even
delete files or folders and diskonaut will track how much space you've
freed up in this session.
