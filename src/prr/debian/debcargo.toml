prr is a tool that brings mailing list style code reviews to Github PRs. This
means offline reviews and inline comments, more or less.

To that end, prr introduces a new workflow for reviewing PRs:
  1. Download the PR into a "review file" on your filesystem
  2. Mark up the review file using your favorite text editor
  3. Submit the review at your convenience

For full documentation, please visit https://doc.dxuuu.xyz/prr/.

This package includes the prr program, as well as manual pages and shell
completions for bash, fish, and zsh.
