anyascii is a command-line tool to convert Unicode characters to their
best ASCII representation.

AnyAscii provides ASCII-only replacement strings for practically all
Unicode characters. Text is converted character-by-character without
considering the context. The mappings for each script are based on popular
existing romanisation systems. Symbolic characters are converted based
on their meaning or appearance. All ASCII characters in the input are
left unchanged, every other character is replaced with printable ASCII
characters. Unknown characters and some known characters are replaced
with an empty string and removed.
